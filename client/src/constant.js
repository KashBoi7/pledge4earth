I just signed the Lead4Earth pledge, because I believe that immediate legislative action is necessary to curb the impacts of climate change. This pledge is a fantastic grassroots initiative to demonstrate the growing public willpower for real, measurable action on climate change by our elected leaders. It is simultaneously a resource and an accountability measure for legislators to understand the urgency and demand for modern, climate-conscious laws.

Will you sign the pledge, join the initiative as a "leader", and lead the way to a more sustainable future?

Thank you so much for your advocacy - we look forward to hearing back.`;
