      <h3>Why Seek Clear Opinion?</h3>
      <p>
		We urge individuals to express their viewpoints with clarity. As more neighbors join the chuckle train, our local leaders will feel a tickle to clarify their standpoints and make rib-tickling statements!
	  </p>
	  <h3>How Do We Use Your Email Address?</h3>
	  <p>We gather email addresses solely for verification purposes. Plus, when you share it with friends or your leader, we'll give you a heads-up when the leader you nudged to pledge actually signs the pledge.</p>
